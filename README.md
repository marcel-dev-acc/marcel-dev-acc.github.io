# js-games
Clone the repo and enjoy the games on your machine!
This repository is meant for you to play and practice your javascript game making capabilities.

## General rules of use
Please feel free to contribute to this repository whenever you wish.
When you want to create a new game, simply create a new folder with you game names (try to keep it short).
Each game folder must have at least two files in it: `main.html` and `game.js`, and one folder `assets` which should hold your sprite sheet.
1) main.html contains you single page application where you game loads into
2) game.js contains all your javascript code

## To run in a local host environment
Testing can be done locally invoking the command `python3 -m http.server 8001` in the root directory.
